# ScentryAuthDemo #

## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd ScentryAuthDemo
$ ./sbt
> container:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.

Log in as:

user: foo
password: foo

To logout, hit http://localhost:8080/sessions/logout. It's not a pretty route, and it's an unsafe GET, but it's the
easiest way to illustrate logout functionality.
