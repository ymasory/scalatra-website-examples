This is an example application demonstrating the use of validation commands
in the [Scalatra](http://scalatra.org) web framework. Note: the JavaScript parts
aren't currently complete (pull requests welcome if you're interested in that).

We're primarily interested in showing how the commands work on the server side.

A full tutorial on the use of validation commands is available on the
[Scalatra website](http://scalatra.org/guides/commands.html).

## Build & Run ##

```sh
$ cd 2.4/formats/scalatra-commands
$ chmod u+x sbt
$ ./sbt
> container:start
> browse
```

If `browse` doesn't launch your browser, manually open [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080/) in your browser.
